* For Mac users *

1. Download sox-14.4.0-macosx.zip from http://sourceforge.net/projects/sox (the website should detect the 
download appropriate for your system).

2. Unzip the file and remember the location of that folder.  (To get the location, right-click on the folder, and 
choose "Get Info".  Look for "Where:".  What appears after is the location of the folder, e.g. 
"/Users/fvcproductions/sox-14.4.1".)

3. Open Terminal.

4. In Terminal, type: cd <sox folder> (use quotes if there is a space in the name)
  
   e.g. cd /Users/fvcproductions/sox-14.4.1
	(this folder has no spaces, so no quotes are necessary)

7. Copy secret.wav from the homework webpage into the sox folder

8. In Terminal: (with the sound file you wish to convert in the sox folder as well), type

    ./sox secret.wav secret.dat

9. Now you should see the converted file secret.dat in the sox folder.
