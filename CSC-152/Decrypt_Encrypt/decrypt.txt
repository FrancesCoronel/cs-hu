The Stack class represents a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack of objects.It extends class Vector with five operations that allow a vector to be treated as a stack. 
The usual push and pop operations are provided,as well as a method to peek at the top item on the stack,a method to test for whether the stack is empty,and a method to search the stack for an item and discover how far it is from the top. 
When a stack is first created, it contains no items.
