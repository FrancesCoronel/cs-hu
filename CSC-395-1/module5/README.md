# Module 4: Basic JavaScript and jQuery (Light weight JavaScript)

---

## Objective

To learn basic JavaScript and jQuery to create dynamic webpages.

---

## Scenario

You are to create this dynamic webpages using JavaScript. You can add these files to the crudjsp web that you create from last week.

---

### Step 1

Create a new file in your WebContent, called LASTNAME_basicJS.html (reference: http://www.w3schools.com/js )

- Add necessary information to the title and heading of this page to be “My First JavaScript”
- Create a table format with 3 columns where first column will give the assignment task, 2nd column will give the button, and 3rd column will be the result. (make any format as you wish of the table)

**A. Show Date & Time:**

- Create a button to display current date & time (see http://www.w3schools.com/js)

**B. Switch Image:**
- Using HTML attributes to change the image (seehttp://www.w3schools.com/js/js_intro.asp for turn on/off the light)- You will find two different pictures to demonstrate how you can change HTML attributes to switch image (e.g. an avatar that one has a hat and another without a hat.)- Extra Credit: Have at least 5 pictures, using a button to change an image (in sequence or random).

**C. Validate Data**

- Create a JavaScript function to validate a text-box input (see http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_intro.asp) with an example- You will create 3 text-boxes where the user will have to enter their birth date (day, month, and year). You will write a function to check if the date within a month is correct. For example, February has 28 days, except on the leap year. Provide appropriate error message- **Extra Credit:** Add a function to check if a person is older than 18 years. 
	-  You may need to use the following resources
	- Syntax: http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_syntax.asp
	- Statement: http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_statements.asp
	- Variables: http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp
	- Operators: http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_operators.asp
	- Functions: http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp
	- (additional resources on w3schools.com)

**D. String and String methods**
- See http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_strings.asp andhttp://www.w3schools.com/js/js_string_methods.asp- You will create
	- a text-box or text-area that the user will enter
	- a button that say “count vowels”
	- a JavaScript function called countVowels – that will take the text and count how many a, e, i, o, u are there in the text. You need a count for each vowel.
	- once the button is clicked, you will call a function countVowels and print the output on the screen.
	- HINT: you should create a div or p tag for this so that you can change the content using innerHTML

**E. Number and Number methods**
- See http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_numbers.asp,http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_number_methods.asp andhttp://www.w3schools.com/js/js_math.asp
- You will create
	- 5 text-boxes for 5 numbers to be enter
	- A button that say “get statistics”
	- A JavaScript function called getStats – that will look at these 5 values and then find min, max, sum, and average of these 5 numbers
	-  Once the button is clicked you will call getStats functionand print the output on the screen
- HINT: you should create a div or p tag for this so that you can change the content using innerHTML 

---

### Step 2

Create a new file in your WebContent, called LASTNAME_calculator.html

- For this page, you will use what you learn thus far HTML and JavaScript tocreate a basic calculator -- addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,modulus (remainder), square-root, inverse (1/x) ).
- **Extra Credit:**
	- Add a feature that show the history,like the calculator on Windows or Mac (HINT: you can create a div or p tag, and keep adding new text node to it. http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_nodes.asp)

---

### Step 3

Create a new file in your WebContent, called LASTNAME_basicSlide.html

- Resource: http://www.w3schools.com/jquery
- If you do not want to down, just make sure to add this tag in the head your HTML file

		<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script>  

- **SlideDown/SlideUp** (Toggle) (see http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_slide.asp)
	- Use example to create a new content to show and hide the information (e.g.weather, news, etc. – just choose one)

---

### Step 4

Create a new file in your WebContent, called LASTNAME_basicAnimation.html
- Basic Animation (see http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_animate.asp)
	- See various examples on the above page
	- You will create something similar to the “StartAnimation” example on this page, but have your name and your favorite color
