    <string name="lorem_ipsum">
        Any way you slice it, boosting your intake of fruit and cutting back on the amount of meat
        you eat improves the nutritional quality of your diet. Fruit is packed with vitamins,
        minerals, fiber and disease-fighting phytonutrients and antioxidants. On the other hand,
        meat is one of the largest sources of fat, saturated fat and cholesterol in Americans’
        diets. Fortunately, it’s easy to tip your dietary scale in favor of fruit.
