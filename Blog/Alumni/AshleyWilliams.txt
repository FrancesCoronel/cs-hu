>> Take advantage of the opportunities that the department gives you. There are so many other schools that don't give or provide their students with the opportunities that Hampton does. NETWORK in Hampton and outside of Hampton! I made some amazing connections through Hampton events, and even course projects (i.e. doing research for my senior seminar project). Most importantly, DON'T GIVE UP!
