- Major and Grad Year 🎓

> Computer Science, '2013

- Where did you end up going for grad school? 📚

> [University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu/ "UW")

- What are you up to these days? 📅

> I'm finishing my Master's degree in HCI from UW, and currently working for the [Office of Minority Affairs](http://www.washingtonmesa.org/ "Washington MESA") here. In addition, I will be working for [Appian](http://www.appian.com/ "Appian") upon graduation as a software developer.

- What's your official position title? 📋

> Current: Graduate Researcher at [UW Office of Minority Affairs](http://www.washingtonmesa.org/ "Washington MESA")

> Upon Graduating: Associate Architect at [Appian](http://www.appian.com/ "Appian")

- Why did you choose your major? 😍

> Passion.
  
 - What is your advice to underclassmen? 💬

> I would definitely say to work with your peers -- your cohort is a small family, and you all will struggle together to get through the program. It is a very humbling, and rewarding experience if you put your best efforts forward. Dr. Muhammad, Dr. Boonthum, and the rest of the staff and department make sure that no matter what happens, you will get out what you put in to this department. Put your best foot forward, work hard, and understand that with Computer Science, and with the right determination, there's nothing that you cannot accomplish! Hopefully with this alumni network that we are continuing to build, we can keep extending the "CSCFam" down the line. Lastly, do your best to attain an internship, whether it be in industry or research. These things will only prepare you for the next steps after graduation, and help your resume have some weight.
