1. How do you feel about getting your internship?

> I feel great, it feels like all my hard work paid off. 

---

2. What steps did you take to get your internship?
 
> I basically just applied online and I stayed persistent. 

---

3. What were some of the hardships you faced?

> It's hard applying to internships and being anxious. Not knowing whether the email that you will receive will be an acceptance or rejection can be nerve-wracking. But you know, once you do receive that acceptance letter, you feel ecstatic and relieved. The feeling of having a secure internship before summer is one thing, but having an internship before the semester is over -- something like that rarely happens given most interns get picked up the Spring semester. So the fact that I got picked up before is a huge surprise.

4. How did you prepare for the interview?

> I talked to upperclassmen and talked to some grad students - having [Cam](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/cameron-peele/55/817/710) here - he was my mentor for my freshman year. So to have him still here as a grad student and for him to help me through the process and helping me with classes makes a big difference. So having my mentors made a big difference. Dr. Muhammad also helped.

5. How was your interview process? 

> I just had a phone interview but I did visit their Manassas location for an on-site interview. 
> For the phone interview, I felt like I did terrible, but the onsite interview I felt I did stellar. I was never one for phone interviews, I prefer one-on-one interaction when it comes to companies and representatives.

6. What's going to be happening at your internship?

> Well, I'll be a *College Student Tech Intern* with the *Lockheed Martin Mission Systems and Training Team* in Orlando, Florida. The role description includes technical planning, system integration, verification, and validation on a multi-disciplinary software engineering team.

---

7. What tips or tricks would you offer current freshman for their internship process?

> Well, first of all, thanks for having me. Second of all, I would have to say that you've got to stay persistent, don't give up, and apply everywhere. Don't be intimidated by GPA results to apply. Don't let your GPA discourage you from applying.
