1.What steps did you take to get your internship?

> I applied online after attending the info session. After I applied online, about 2 weeks later I got an email from Dr. Muhammad telling me to forward her my resume. Two days after that, I got an email from Lockheed Martin saying that they would like me to come up and interview.

2.How did you prepare for the interview?

> I went on [Glassdoor](glassdoor.com) and looked at advice/tips about the type of questions they would be asking and practiced those. I also went over my resume in depth since I knew that they would be asking about my resume. I practiced general questions with my parents as well.

3.How was your interview process? 

> I was dressed in business casual. I would recommend dressing up in business formal because I was the only one in business casual (awkward), even though it said business casual. I had 3 interviews with 3 different people in total, with each about 20 to 30 minutes long. They asked me a lot about my resume. It’s important that you’re able to talk about the classes you’ve taken. It was a great experience.

4.What are you going to be doing at your internship?

> My official title is *College Student Technical Senior*. I’ll be working with the Mission Systems and Training branch. I was told I would be doing a lot of programming for submarine defense technologies. Apparently, I'll be coding in `Java`, `JavaScript`, and some `C++`. I’ll be located in Manassas, VA.

5.What tips or tricks would you offer current freshman for their internship process?

> You want to sell yourself, be confident, you want to look presentable, and you want to have well thought out answers to questions. And make sure you have questions to ask yourself.
