Problem 1.5

#1

15 * 29 mod 13

15 mod 13 = 2

so now find other integers with that same relation which would just be for 15 the following:

= { 15 - 13(-1), 15 + 13(0), 15 + 13(1), 15 + 13(2), 15 + 13 (3) }

= { 2, 15, 28, 41 }

for 29, it would be:

= { 15 - 13(-1), 15 + 13(0), 15 + 13(1), 15 + 13(2), 15 + 13 (3) }

= { 2, 15, 28, 41 }

so now we choose smallest positive integer in those relations:

2 * 3 mod 13 = 6

Z(13) = { 0, 1, 2, … 12 }
     = { 13, 14, 15 .., 24}

#2

2 * 29 mod 13

#3

2 *3 mod 13

#4

-11 * 3 mod 13

Problem 1.6

# 1

1/5 mod 13

—> get inverse

5^-1 mod 13

—> (5)(5^-1) mod 13 = 1

(5^-1) mod 13 = 1/5 mod 13 = 8

# 2

1/5 mod 7

—> get inverse

5^-1 mod 7

—> (5)(5^-1) mod 7 = 1

(5^-1) mod 7  = 1/5 mod 7 = 3

because 7/3 = 2 remainder 1

{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 }

# 2.1

1/5 mod 15 = DNE

because all results end up being 0

# 3

3 * 2/5 mod 7

= 3 * 2 * 1/5 * mod 7

= 3 * 2 * 1/5 mod 7 * mod 7

= 3 * 2 * 3 mod 7

= 6 * 3 mod 7

= 18 mod 7 = 4

Problem 1.7

# 0 Construct addition table for Z(4).

you just add x and y together and then mod 4

if it adds or multiplies to 4, it will be 0

+   0   1   2   3
0   0   1   2   3
1   1   1   3   0
2   0   3   0   5
3   0   0   1   6

# 1 Construct multiplication table for Z(4)

you just multiply x and y together

if it adds or multiplies to 4, it will be 0

x   0   1   2   3
0   0   0   0   0
1   0   1   2   3
2   0   2   4   6
3   0   3   6   9

# 2 Construct addition and multiplication table for Z(5)

+   0   1   2   3   4
0   0   1   2   3   4
1   1   2   3   4   0
2   2   3   4   0   1
3   3   4   0   1   2
4   4   0   1   2   3

if it adds up to 5, it will be 0
first row and column is always same as header row
second row is opposite of first row
addition is very simple since there’s just a shift of zeros

x   0   1   2   3   4
0   0   0   0   0   0
1   0   1   2   0   4
2   0   2   4   1   3
3   0   3   1   4   2
4   0   4   3   2   1

first row is always 0
second row is always same as header row
same with first and 2nd column
last column and row are always 0, and then opposite of header row so for 5, it would be 0, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

# 4 There are elements in Z(4) and Z(6) without a multiplicative inverse - what are they?

answer: 2, 3, and 4

Z(4) = { 0, 1, 2, 3 }

Z(6) = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }

A multiplicative inverse is when

a * a^-1 mod m = 1

if gcd(a, m) = 1 ==> a^-1 exists

so for Z(6), m = 6 and a is any number from Z(6)

so

for Z(6)

gcd(0, 6) = 1
gcd(1, 6) = 1
gcd(2, 6) = not 1 —> does not have multiplicative inverse
gcd(3, 6) = not 1 —> does not have multiplicative inverse
gcd(4, 6) = not 1 —> does not have multiplicative inverse
gcd(5, 6) = 1

for Z(4)

gcd(0, 4) = 1
gcd(1, 4) = 1
gcd(2, 4) = not 1 —> does not have multiplicative inverse
gcd(3, 4) = 1

Problem 1.9

# 1

x = 3^2 mod 13
x = 9

# 2

x = 7^2 mod 13
x = 10

#3 x = 3^10 mod 13

x = 3^4 * 3^4 * 3^2 mod 13
x = 81 * 81 * 9 mod 13
x = 81 mod 13 —> find smallest class
—> get smallest class
x = 3 * 3 * 9 mod 13
x = 81 mod 13
x = 3

#4 x = 7^100 mod 13

= (7^2)^50 mod 13

= 7^2 mod 13 = 49 mod 13 = 10 so it simplifies to

= 10^50 mod 13

= (10^2)25 mod 13

—> 10^2 mod 13 =  100 mod 13 = 9

= (9)^25 mod 13

= (3^2)^25 mod 13 = (3^5)^10 mod 13

= (243)^10 mod 13

—> 243 mod 13 = 9

= (9)^10 mod 13

= (9^2)^5 mod 13 = (81)^5 mod 13

—> 81 mod 13 = 3

= (3)^5 mod 13 = 9

#5 7^x = 11 mod 13

{ 7, 49, 343, … }

right side: { 11, 24, 37, 50 … }

7^x = 49

x = 7^5 mod 13
x = 63 mod 13
x = 5

#6 3^x = 11 mod 13

{ 3, 9, 27, … }

right side: { 11, 24, 37, 50 … }

3^x = 9

x = 3^1 mod 13
x = 3 mod 13
x = DNE

# 10 For all integers n between 0 <= n < m that are relatively prime to m for m = 4, 5, 9, 26. We denote the number of integers n which fulfill the condition by o(m), e.g. o(3) = 2. This function is called Euler’s phi function. What is o(m) for m = 4, 5, 9, 26.

Euler phi function

o(m) = number of integers that are prime between [o, m).

1, 3 —> o(4) = 2

o(5) = 3
to check, n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

o(26) = 12

#13 Attack scenario. Oscars get two pair of plaintext-cipher text (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). What is condition for choosing x1 and x2.

y1 = (a * x1 + b) mod 26

y2 = (a * x2 + b) mod 26

 —> ergo

a = (y1 - y2)((x2 - x1)^(-1) mod 26)

—> which means that (x^2-x^1)^-1 must exist to work

gcd ((x1 - x2), 26) = 1
