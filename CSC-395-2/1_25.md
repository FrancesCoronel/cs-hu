## find key space for 26 letters/characters

a = all odd #s up to 25

1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23

12 in total

gcd(a,26) = 1

possible keys = 12 * 26 values = 312 values

## encryption function

(a, b)

m = # of characters

p = # equivalent to character to encrypt

E(p) = (ap + b) mod m

## decryption function

(a, b)

m = # of characters

D(p) = a^-1 (c-b) mod m

so the inverse of a mod m = real a

D(p) = ((real a)(c-b)) mod m
