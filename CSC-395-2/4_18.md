# RSA Algorithm

> modular arithmetic with large numbers
> asynchronous encryption/decryption

public key; private key

sender --> receiver

if sender encrypts plain text message with public key, receive can only decrypt it using private key

---

## Encryption

E(P, K(B), PublicKey)

> (e, n) = public key

> (d, n) = private key

M = plain text message = C^d mod n = (M^e mod n)^d mod n = M^(ed) mod n

C = cipher text message = M^e mod n

> ed = 1^(mod n)

> d = e^-1 mod n

---

## Decryption

D(C, K(B), PrivateKey)

## Step by Step

refer to page 280 in Stallings book

1. choose p, q

> p and q are prime numbers
> p ≠ q

n = p * q

Φ = (n) = (p-1)(q-1)

2. choose "e" (part of public key)

gcd (e, Φ(n)) = 1

1 < e < Φ(n)

3. calculate d = e^-1 mod (Φ(n))

public key = (e, n)

C = M^e mod Φ(n)

private key = (d, n)

M = C^d mod Φ(n)

---

## Overview of Process

1. p = 17, q = 11 (random prime #s)

2. n = p * q = 187

> n = 187

3. Φ(n) = (p - 1) * (q - 1) = 16 * 10 = 160

> Φ(n) = 160

4. choose "e":

gcd(e, 160) = 1
choose e = 7

> 7 as random prime number selected

> e has to be prime in relation to Φ(n)

> public key = (e, n) = (7, 187)

5. calculate d

d = e^-1 mod Φ(n) = 7^-1 mod 160 = 23

6. generate private key using private key = (d, n)

> private key = (23, 187)

## Example 1

plaintext = M = 88

### encryption

select p, q, e
p = 17
q = 11
e = 187

M^e mod n = 88^7 mod 187

so C = 11

public key = (e, n) = (7, 187)

private key = (d, n) = (23, 187)

### decryption

C = 11

private key = (d, n) = (23, 187)

C^d mod n = 11^23 mod 187 = 88

## computational complexity

( a x b ) mod n = ( a mod n ) ( b mod n )

a^16

First find a x a = a^2

Then find a^2 x a^2 = a^4

Then find a^4 x a^4 = a^8

Then find a^8 x a^8 = a^16

b as binary form:

b(k) b(k-1) b(k-2) ... b(1) b(0)
