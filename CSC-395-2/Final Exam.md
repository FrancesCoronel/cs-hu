If the input for substitution box (S-box) is given as: 2F0890983517, what is the output of S-box?

1) convert hexadecimal to binary
2) pair all 6 pairs together
3) use s-1 for first 6 binary numbers and so on and so forth so row 1, column 5 for 001011 since its 01 for row and 0101 for column
4) repeat for all 8 s-boxes
5) convert row and column to binary numbers using tables
6) now that we have binary format, we convert that to hexadecimal format and we're done

# AES Encryption

- won't be asked to expand key yourself
- substitute bytes
- figure 5.5 - s-box figure

# More Topics Covered

- s-box for AES (page 157) -> table 5.2.a --> forward s-box

for example, plain text (16 bytes) --> substitute bytes --> 16 bytes

69 --> s1, 1 --> x = 6, y = 9

67 --> x = 6, y = 7

inverse s-box --> so use a different table

- hill cipher with matrix calculations (example of stream cipher) - from chapter 2
